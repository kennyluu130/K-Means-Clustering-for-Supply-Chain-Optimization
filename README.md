# Walmart Supply Chain Optimization with K-Means Clustering

## Project Description
This project uses **K-Means clustering** to identify optimal supply chain facility locations for Walmart stores in California. By clustering store locations based on geographic coordinates, the analysis provides a data-driven approach to minimize delivery distances and improve logistics efficiency.  

For a full write-up and detailed explanation, check out the Medium article: [K-Means Clustering for Supply Chain Optimization](https://medium.com/@kennyluu130/k-means-clustering-for-supply-chain-optimization-a-walmart-case-study-947c0eb6913c)

## Skills & Tools
**Skills:** Data preprocessing, clustering, geospatial visualization  
**Tools:** Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Google Colab

## Dataset
The dataset includes Walmart store locations across the United States, with information such as latitude, longitude, address, city, state, and ZIP code. Only stores in California were used for this analysis. The dataset is publicly available on Kaggle.  

## Installation
To run the project locally:
1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/walmart-kmeans.git
cd walmart-kmeans
```
2. Install required Python packages:
```
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn requests
```
3. Open the Jupyter notebook:
```
jupyter notebook walmart_kmeans.ipynb
```

Alternatively, you can run the notebook directly in Google Colab: [![Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1V0beUg55spoXqZAlqpJv13AzRorN4Bl0?usp=sharing)
